In this Project we built a Todo App using React.js and Firebase. With React we created a client that sends data to firebase firestore to store and also a client that consumes the stored data, with Firebase firestore we were able to save the data client provided and give back the said data to the client. For more resources on these tools, visit the documentation of React and Firebase.
